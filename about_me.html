                        <p class="card-text">  I am a senior at Columbia University in the City of New York studying biochemistry.
                                I am a
                                <a href="https://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/srf" target="_blank">Science Research Fellow</a> in the Columbia Undergraduate Scholars Program which means that I have made scientific
                                research the cornerstone of my undergraduate experience. I have used my funding to work in a variety of laboratories
                                during the semesters and summers. My experiences have expanded my lab skills and deepened my understanding and
                                appreciation for biological sciences. You can read about my projects
                                <a href="projects.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I am passionate about spreading my love for science through my involvement in the
                                <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2017/10/03/a-case-for-more-science-in-the-core/" target="_blank">Columbia Science Review</a> publication, which seeks to improve science literacy on campus.
                        </p>
                        <p> Aside from research, I also serve as the VP Internal for the Columbia University chapter of Girls Who Code, an organization
                                with the mission to close the gender gap in tech. In high school, I had always been fascinated by computer science
                                but didn&#39;t have any opportunities to take classes to explore that interest. I envied my male friends that
                                had taught themselves how to code but felt too intimidated to try teaching myself. I finally took my first
                                computer science and programming courses in my freshman year of college, but as a biochemistry student, I didn&#39;t have much
                                free space in my schedule to explore CS further. Through Girls Who Code at Columbia University, I can ensure
                                that high school girls have access to the education and experiences I wish I had. Building this website is an
                                opportunity for me to apply some of the web development skills I have gained over time and hopefully jumpstart
                                my pursual of other technical projects.

                                        for my ukelele, run long distance (I'm currently training for a marathon), and meet new people. Feel free to
