            <p>Hi, my name is Anubhuti, but I go by Anu! I am a senior at Columbia University in the City of New York studying
                biochemistry. I am a
                <a href="https://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/srf" target="_blank">Science Research Fellow</a> in the Columbia Undergraduate Scholars Program which means that I have made scientific
                research the cornerstone of my undergraduate experience. I have used my funding to work in a variety of laboratories
                during the semesters and summers. My experiences have expanded my lab skills and deepened my understanding
                and appreciation for biological sciences. You can read about my projects
                <a href="projects.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I am passionate about spreading my love for science through my involvement in the
                <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2017/10/03/a-case-for-more-science-in-the-core/" target="_blank">Columbia Science Review</a> publication, which seeks to improve science literacy on campus. </p>

            <p> Aside from research, I also serve at the VP Internal for the Columbia University chapter of Girls Who Code, an
                organization with the mission to close the gender gap in tech. In high school, I had always been fascinated
                by computer science but didn&#39;t have any opportunities to take classes to explore that interest. I envied
                my male friends that had taught themselves how to code but felt too intimidated to try teaching myself. I
                finally took my first introductory computer science course in my freshman year of college, but as a biochemistry
                student, I didn&#39;t have much free space in my schedule to explore CS further. Through Girls Who Code at
                Columbia University, I can ensure that high school girls have access to the education and experiences I wish
                I had. Building this website is an opportunity for me to apply some of the web development skills I have
                gained over time and hopefully inspire me to pursue other technical projects.</p>

        <p>Outside of academics I absolutely love to dance with my competitive Indian dance team Columbia Raas, write songs
            with my ukelele, run long distance (I'm currently training for a marathon), and meet new people. Feel free to
